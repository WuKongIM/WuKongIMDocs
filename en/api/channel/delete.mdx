## Response Fields

<ResponseField name="status" type="string" required>

</ResponseField>

## Status Codes

| Status Code | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| 200 | Channel deleted successfully |
| 400 | Request parameter error |
| 403 | No deletion permission |
| 404 | Channel does not exist |
| 500 | Internal server error |

## Deletion Impact

### Data Cleanup

Deleting a channel will clean up the following related data:

| Data Type | Cleanup Scope | Impact |
|-----------|---------------|--------|
| Channel Info | Channel basic info, settings | Channel completely disappears |
| Member Relationships | All member subscription relationships | Members can no longer receive messages |
| Message History | All messages in the channel | Message records permanently deleted |
| Conversation Records | Channel in user conversation lists | Channel removed from conversation lists |

### User Impact

- **Member Notification**: All members will receive channel dissolution notification
- **Conversation Cleanup**: Channel removed from all members' conversation lists
- **Message Loss**: Message history in the channel will be unrecoverable
- **Permission Invalidation**: All channel-related permissions immediately invalidated

## Permission Requirements

### Personal Channel (channel_type = 1)

- **Participants**: Any participant in the channel can delete it
- **System Administrator**: Has permission to delete any personal channel

### Group Channel (channel_type = 2)

- **Group Owner**: Only the group owner can dissolve the group
- **System Administrator**: Has permission to delete any group
- **Regular Members**: No deletion permission, can only leave the group

## Security Considerations

### Deletion Confirmation

Recommend secondary confirmation before deletion:

1. **Permission Verification**: Confirm the operator has deletion permission
2. **Identity Verification**: Require password or verification code input
3. **Impact Warning**: Clearly inform the scope of deletion impact
4. **Final Confirmation**: Provide a final chance to cancel

### Data Backup

Consider data backup before deletion:

- **Message Export**: Allow export of important messages
- **Member List**: Save member information for rebuilding
- **File Backup**: Backup important files in the channel
- **Operation Logging**: Record detailed information about deletion operations

## Alternative Solutions

### Soft Delete

For important channels, consider soft deletion:

- **Hide Channel**: Hide from user interface but retain data
- **Disable Features**: Prohibit sending messages but retain history
- **Set Expiration**: Set automatic deletion time
- **Permission Revocation**: Remove all member permissions

### Archive Processing

- **Message Archive**: Transfer messages to archive storage
- **Read-only Mode**: Set to read-only status
- **History Viewing**: Allow viewing but no operations
- **Periodic Cleanup**: Regularly clean up archived data

## Best Practices

1. **Permission Control**: Strictly control deletion permissions to prevent misoperations
2. **Operation Logging**: Detailed logging of deletion operations including time, operator, reason
3. **Notification Mechanism**: Timely notification to all related members
4. **Data Backup**: Perform data backup before deleting important channels
5. **Recovery Mechanism**: Provide recovery functionality within a certain time period
6. **Batch Deletion**: Support batch deletion of multiple channels
